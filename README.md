# AI Engineering One-Year Study Repository (ai_source)

This repository organizes a 12‑month intensive AI engineering curriculum and contains:
- curriculum/: month-level guides and resource lists
- projects/: week-level code projects (Weeks 1–12 sample included)
- tools/: environment and CI/CD templates
- datasets/: sample data and pointers
- infra/: Docker, k8s, Terraform examples
- portfolio/: project showcase scaffolding
- notes/: reading list and weekly journal files

How to get started locally:
1. Clone or create the repo and run the scaffold script that generated this layout.
2. Create a Python virtual environment and install per-project requirements as needed.
3. Use branches per week when implementing: e.g., `git checkout -b week-01-matrix-lib`

This scaffold is intended as a starting point. Customize and extend it as you implement projects and experiments.
